### Question 3

(a) $$l1$$ distance is metric. 
1. 
 $$d(x, y) = ||x-y||_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{m}|x_i-y_i| \geq \sum_{i=1}^{m}0 = 0 $$ 
2. 
    * $$d(x, y) = 0 \Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^{m}|x_i-y_i| = 0 \Rightarrow |x_i - y_i|=0 \text{ for each i}$$ $$\Rightarrow x_i = y_i\text{ for each i} \Rightarrow x=y$$.  
    * $$x=y \Rightarrow x_i = y_i \text{ for each i} \Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^{m}|x_i - y_i| = 0 \Rightarrow d(x, y) = 0$$
3. 
$$d(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}|x_i-y_i| = \sum_{i=1}^{m}|y_i-x_i| = d(y, x)$$
4.  
$$d(x, y) + d(y, z) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}|x_i-y_i| + \sum_{i=1}^{m}|y_i-z_i| = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(|x_i-y_i|+|y_i-z_i|) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{m}(|x_i-z_i|) = d(x, z)$$

(b) $$d_1 + d_2$$ is metric

Let $$D = d_1 + d_2$$, then $$d(x,y)=D(x-y)=d_1(x-y)+d_2(x-y)=d_1(x,y) + d_2(x,y)$$

1. 
Since $$d_1(x,y) \geq 0$$ and $$d_2(x,y)\geq 0$$ and $$d(x,y) = d_1(x,y) + d_2(x,y)$$, we have $$d(x,y) \geq 0$$.
2. Since $$d_1(x,y) \geq 0$$, $$d_2(x,y) \geq 0$$, and $$d(x,y) = d_1(x,y) + d_2(x,y)$$, we have $$d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow d_1(x, y) = 0 \text{ and } d_2(x,y)=0 \Leftrightarrow x=y$$.
3. $$d(x,y) = d_1(x,y) + d_2(x,y) = d_1(y, x) + d_2(y, x)=d(y,x)$$.
4. $$d(x,z) = d_1(x, z) + d_2(x, z)  \leq d_1(x, y) + d_1(y,z) + d_2(x,y)+d_2(y,z) = $$  
$$(d_1(x, y) + d_2(x,y)) + (d_1(y,z) +d_2(y,z)) = d(x,y) + d(y, z)$$

(c) Hamming distance is metric.
From the definition of Hamming distance, 
* $$d(x, y) \geq 0$$ is true since the number of different positions must $$\geq 0$$;  
* $$d(x, y)=0 \Leftrightarrow \text{ x and y are equal in every position} \Leftrightarrow x = y$$; 
* $$d(x,y) = d(y,x)$$ is true since changing the value of x,y with each other doesn't influence the number of positions on which those to values are different.
* Suppose $$S_a$$ is the set of positions on which x and y are differ, $$S_b$$ is the set of positions on which y and z are differ. Thus, x and z are differ for all positions in $$S_a - (S_a \cap S_b) \text{ and }  S_b - (S_a\cap S_b)$$ (For those in the first one, x y are different and y z are same; and for those in the second one x y are same and y z different). For those positions in $$(S_a \cap S_b)$$, x z may or may not different since x y are different and y z are different. For those positions out of $$S_a \text{ and } S_b$$, x y z are the same.   
Therefore, $$d(x,z) <= |S_a - (S_a \cap S_b)| + |S_b - (S_a\cap S_b)| + |S_a \cap S_b|$$ by inclusionâ€“exclusion principle $$ = |S_a| + |S_b| - |S_a\cap S_b| = d(x, y) + d(y, z) - |S_a\cap S_b| <= d(x, y) + d(y, z)$$.

(d) Squared Euclidean is not metric.  
Consider the case where $$m=1, x=1, y=0, z=-1$$, then $$d(x,z) = 4, d(x,y) = 1, d(y,z) = 1$$. Thus, $$d(x,z) > d(x,y) + d(y,z)$$

(e) Kullback-leibler dvergence is not metric.  
Consider the case where $$p=\be$$
