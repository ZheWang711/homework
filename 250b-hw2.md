### Question2

In the case of binary classification with an abstain option, we only have 3 possible choice for $$y$$ given $$x$$.

* Case 1: Predicting $$y = 1$$.  
Then $$E(cost)= 0*P(y=1|x) +1*P(y=0|x) = 1- \eta(x)$$

* Case 2: Predicting $$y=0$$.  
Then $$E(cost)=1*P(y=1|x) +0*P(y=0|x) = \eta(x)$$

* Case 3: Predicting $$y=abstain$$, the expected cost is $$\theta$$.

Therefore, in order to get minimum expected cost, we can choose $$y$$ in the way such that the corresponding cost smallest among the above 3 cases.

$$h^*(x) = $$
