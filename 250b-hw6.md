* list of k-means clusters  
The clusters does makes since. (E.g. different kind of fish/whale are clustered in one cluster.)

##Question 2

**(a)**

Let $$f(\mu) = \sum_{x \in C} ||x-\mu||^2 = \sum_{x \in C}(x-\mu)^T(x-\mu)$$, Then we have $$f'(\mu) = 2\sum_{x \in C}(x-\mu)$$.

To minimize $$f(\mu)$$, simply $$f'(\mu)=0$$, we get $$\mu=\frac{\sum_{x \in C}x}{|C|}$$, which is the mean of points $$C$$.

**(b)**

* A counter example is $$x_0 = 1; x_1 = -1. x_2 = 100$$, the average value is $$x = 30$$, which has error $$29+31+70=130$$. However, if we choose exactly the point $$x=1$$, the error will be $$2+99=101$$, which is smaller than $$130$$.

* Now, let's figure out the optimal $$\mu$$ in this special case:

For 1-d points $$C$$, we can separate them into 2 subsets: $$S$$ -- the set of points smaller than $$\mu$$; and $$L$$ -- the set of points greater or equal to $$\mu$$, thus:

$$f(\mu)=\sum_{x\in C}|x-\mu| = \sum_{x\in S}(\mu-x) + \sum_{x\in L}(x-\mu)$$

$$f'(\mu) = |S| - |L|$$

In order to minimize $$f(\mu)$$, we try to find the $$\mu$$ such that $$f'(\mu) = |S| - |L|$$. Note that $$|S|$$ is the number of points smaller than $$\mu$$, and $$|L|$$ is the number of points greater or equal to $$\mu$$.

Therefore, we can choose $$\mu$$ in the following way:
 * Case 1: There are even number of points in $$S$$ ==> chose $$\mu$$ anywhere between the 2 medians of points $$C$$. This can be proved optimal since this case $$f'(\mu)=0$$
 * Case 2: There are odd number of points in $$S$$ ==> choose $$\mu$$ exact at median of points $$C$$. This can also be proved optimal: let $$x_m$$ be the median point, the total distance = $$0 + OPT( C-{x_m})$$. We can't pick a better point since the distance will be $$d + D(C-x_m)$$ > total distance, since $$d > 0$$ and $$D(C-x_m) > OPT( C-{x_m})$$.
